## Features

This extension has a really simple feature: a preventative measure to ensure your AWS infrastructure remains compliant by detecting risks in template files before they are launched into AWS.

More info about the scanner over [here](https://github.com/cloudconformity/documentation-api/blob/master/TemplateScanner.md).

## Requirements

You ***need*** to configure your API Key and you ***might*** need to configure the endpoint region, as it defaults to us-west-2.  To do so, see the Extension Settings below:

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `cc.apikey`: a string with your Cloud Conformity API key.
* `cc.region`: Defaults to `us-west-2`. Change it to your Cloud Conformity used endpoint.
* `cc.output`: Defaults to `tab`. Valid options are `tab`, `table`, `json` or `csv`.
* `cc.defaultAccountId`: Optional. Defaults to null. Set a default AccountID if you don't want to use the default.
* `cc.defaultProfileId`: Optional. Defaults to null. Set a default ProfileID if you don't want to use the default.

If you need help on how to edit these settings, you can find more info [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings).

## How to Use It?

First, open VS Code Command Palette (⇧⌘P on Mac or Ctrl+⇧+P on Windows). Then:

1* You can scan the current open file through:
> "Cloud One Conformity: Scan Current Open Template."

2* You can scan any other template right-clicking the file and selecting:
> "Cloud One Conformity: Scan Selected Template."

### Attention Serverless Framework Users

>If you are using the extension to scan Serverless Framework templates, make sure to package your application before running the scan. This capability is only available to AWS applications.

## Known Issues
